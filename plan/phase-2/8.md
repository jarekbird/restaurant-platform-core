# TASK-2.1.8: Convert `MenuItemCard` to a client component

**Section**: 2.1 Cart + Ordering Flow
**Subsection**: 2.1.8
**Task ID**: TASK-2.1.8

## Description

Convert the `MenuItemCard` component to a client component by adding the `'use client'` directive. This is necessary because the component will need to use React hooks (`useCartContext`) and handle user interactions (clicking "Add to Cart" button) in the next task.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/menu/MenuItemCard.tsx` (lines 1-64)

## Current State

- `MenuItemCard` is currently a server component (no `'use client'` directive)
- Component displays menu item information (name, description, price, tags)
- Component is used in `MenuSectionList` which may also need to be a client component
- No interactivity yet - purely presentational
- Component will need cart context access in next task

**Important**: This is a simple conversion task. We're just adding the `'use client'` directive. The actual "Add to Cart" functionality will be added in the next task.

## User Stories

**As a developer**, I need MenuItemCard to be a client component so that I can add interactive features like "Add to Cart" buttons and cart context access.

**As a customer**, the foundation is being prepared so that I can add items to my cart directly from menu items.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `MenuItemCard.tsx` current implementation
- [ ] Understand Next.js client component requirements
- [ ] Check if parent components need to be client components too

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add `'use client'` directive
  - [ ] Add `'use client';` as the first line of the file
  - [ ] Ensure it's before any imports
- [ ] Step 2: Verify imports still work
  - [ ] Check that all imports are compatible with client components
  - [ ] Verify Next.js Image component works in client components (it does)
  - [ ] Verify utility functions work in client components
- [ ] Step 3: Verify component still renders correctly
  - [ ] No visual changes expected
  - [ ] All props should work the same
  - [ ] Styling should be unchanged

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: `'use client'` directive must be first line
  - [ ] Before any imports
  - [ ] Before any code
  - [ ] Exact string: `'use client';`
- [ ] Requirement 2: No breaking changes
  - [ ] Component should render identically
  - [ ] All props should work the same
  - [ ] No visual changes
- [ ] Requirement 3: Imports must be compatible
  - [ ] All imports should work in client components
  - [ ] No server-only imports

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Ensure no server-only features are used
  - [ ] No direct database access
  - [ ] No server-side data fetching
  - [ ] No server-only APIs
- [ ] Verify parent components can still use it
  - [ ] `MenuSectionList` should still be able to render it
  - [ ] No prop changes needed

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit test to verify component renders
  - [ ] Test that component renders with same output
  - [ ] Test that props work correctly
  - [ ] Test that styling is unchanged
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead

### Documentation

- [ ] Add comment explaining why component is client component
- [ ] Note that it will use hooks in next task

### Verification

- [ ] Verify `'use client'` directive is present and correct
- [ ] Verify component compiles without errors
- [ ] Verify TypeScript types are correct
- [ ] Verify no linting errors
- [ ] Verify unit tests pass
- [ ] Verify component renders identically

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 2.1 — Add Full Cart to the Preview System
- **Execution Timing**: Must be completed before TASK-2.1.9 (wire Add to Cart button)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - This is a simple, low-risk change
  - No functionality changes, just enabling client-side features
  - Next task will add the actual cart functionality
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently
- **Current State**: MenuItemCard is a server component
