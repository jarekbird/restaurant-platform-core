Integrate `ChatAssistant` into preview layout

- Import `ChatAssistant` into `app/preview/[slug]/page.tsx` or a layout wrapper.
- Pass menu data (or an identifier) and ensure `ChatAssistant` is within `CartProvider` so it can use `useCartContext`.
- Verify cart changes initiated from chat are reflected in the UI cart drawer and badge.
