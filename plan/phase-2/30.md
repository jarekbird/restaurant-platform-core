Wire `actionParser` results to cart operations

- After receiving an AI response from `/api/chat`, run it through `parseChatAction`.
- Based on the parsed `ChatAction`, call `addItem`, `removeItem`, or `updateQuantity` from `useCartContext`.
- Append system/assistant confirmation messages reflecting what changed in the cart.
