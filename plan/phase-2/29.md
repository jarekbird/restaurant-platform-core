Integrate AI call into `ChatAssistant`

- On `onSend` in `ChatAssistant`, call the client chat helper with:
  - Current conversation history.
  - Current menu (or a menu identifier the server can use).
  - Current cart snapshot from `useCartContext`.
- Append an assistant "typing…" placeholder while waiting, then replace it with the real AI message.
