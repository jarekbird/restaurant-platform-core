# TASK-002: Configure testing environment (Vitest + React Testing Library)

**Section**: A. Tooling & Baseline App Health
**Subsection**: A.2
**Task ID**: T-002

## Description

Configure testing environment (Vitest + React Testing Library). This task involves: Create `vitest.config.ts` with Next.js/React-compatible setup (JSX + TypeScript + alias `@/*`).; Create `test/setup-tests.ts` to import `@testing-library/jest-dom`.; Ensure tests under `test/` or `__tests__/` are picked up by Vitest. This task is part of Tooling & Baseline App Health and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-001]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-001]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-001]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create `vitest.config.ts` with Next.js/React-compatible setup (JSX + TypeScript + alias `@/*`).
- [ ] Step 2: Create `test/setup-tests.ts` to import `@testing-library/jest-dom`.
- [ ] Step 3: Ensure tests under `test/` or `__tests__/` are picked up by Vitest.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **Testing Configuration**:
  - [ ] Vitest must be configured to work with Next.js and React
  - [ ] Test files must be discoverable in `test/` or `__tests__/` directories
  - [ ] TypeScript must be properly configured for test files
  - [ ] Path aliases (`@/*`) must work in test files
  - [ ] Test setup file must be properly imported


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Write appropriate tests if required
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Tooling & Baseline App Health**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-001]
- **Dependencies**: [T-001]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Requires dependencies to be completed first
- **Current State**: See execution-order.md for detailed current state information

## Test Cases / User Stories

The following test cases must be implemented and passing for this task to be considered complete:

### Test Case 1: Code compiles without TypeScript errors

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm run build` completes successfully with no type errors

**User Story**: As a developer, I want code compiles without typescript errors so that `npm run build` completes successfully with no type errors.

---

### Test Case 2: Code passes ESLint validation

**Type**: Lint Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings

**User Story**: As a developer, I want code passes eslint validation so that `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings.

---

### Test Case 3: Vitest can discover and run test files

**Type**: Configuration Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm test` finds and executes test files in `test/` directory

**User Story**: As a developer, I want vitest can discover and run test files so that `npm test` finds and executes test files in `test/` directory.

---

### Test Case 4: Test setup file is loaded

**Type**: Integration Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Test setup file imports are executed before tests run

**User Story**: As a developer, I want test setup file is loaded so that test setup file imports are executed before tests run.

This is a **TESTING TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "Tests are written, all tests pass, and test coverage meets project requirements (if applicable)"

**Test Verification Requirements**:
- [ ] All test cases listed above must be implemented
- [ ] All test cases must pass (`npm test` completes successfully)
- [ ] Test coverage must be maintained or improved
- [ ] No test warnings or errors should be present
- [ ] All user stories must be validated through passing tests
