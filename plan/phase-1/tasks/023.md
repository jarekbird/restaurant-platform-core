## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-030], [T-033], [T-034], [T-040]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Implement the route as specified:
- [ ] Step 2: Call `loadRestaurant(params.slug)`.
- [ ] Step 3: Render `RestaurantLayout` with `config`.
- [ ] Step 4: Inside, render `HeroSection`, `MenuSectionList`, and optionally other blocks.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] Code must follow Global Rules.md guidelines

- [ ] Error handling must be implemented appropriately

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add an integration test using Next.js testing utilities or a mocked module to ensure that given a fake `loadRestaurant` result, the page renders expected content.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3: Routing & Preview Pages**
