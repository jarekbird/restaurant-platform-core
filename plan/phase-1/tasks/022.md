# TASK-022: Implement filesystem-based restaurant loader

**Section**: E. Phase 3: Routing & Preview Pages
**Subsection**: E.22
**Task ID**: T-040

## Description

Implement filesystem-based restaurant loader. This task involves: Create `lib/loaders/restaurant.ts` implementing `loadRestaurant(slug: string)` exactly as in `master-plan.md` (using `fs`, `path`, and the Zod schemas).; Ensure it works in a Node environment (server-side only). This task is part of Phase 3: Routing & Preview Pages and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-021], [T-022], [T-025], [T-026]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-021], [T-022], [T-025], [T-026]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-021], [T-022], [T-025], [T-026]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create `lib/loaders/restaurant.ts` implementing `loadRestaurant(slug: string)` exactly as in `master-plan.md` (using `fs`, `path`, and the Zod schemas).
- [ ] Step 2: Ensure it works in a Node environment (server-side only).

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **Data Loading**:
  - [ ] Function must work in Node.js environment (server-side only)
  - [ ] Function must handle file system errors gracefully
  - [ ] Function must validate loaded data against schemas
  - [ ] Function must return properly typed data
  - [ ] Function must handle missing files or directories appropriately


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add `test/loaders/restaurant-loader.spec.ts` that:
- [ ] Calls `loadRestaurant("so-delicious")`.
- [ ] Asserts the returned `config` and `menu` match expected key properties.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 3: Routing & Preview Pages**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-021], [T-022], [T-025], [T-026]
- **Dependencies**: [T-021], [T-022], [T-025], [T-026]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Requires dependencies to be completed first
- **Current State**: See execution-order.md for detailed current state information
