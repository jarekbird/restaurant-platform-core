**Task ID**: T-020

## Description

Create `lib/schemas` directory structure. This task involves: Create `lib/` and `lib/schemas/` if they do not already exist. This task is part of Phase 1: Domain Modeling and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-001]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-001]
