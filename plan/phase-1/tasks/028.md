# TASK-028: Apply theme classes in components

**Section**: F. Phase 4: Theme System
**Subsection**: F.28
**Task ID**: T-053

## Description

Apply theme classes in components. This task involves: In layout and restaurant components (Hero, FeaturedItems, etc.), call `useTheme()` and apply Tailwind classes from the theme object to root containers, headings, and key elements.; Ensure class composition works well with optional `className` props. This task is part of Phase 4: Theme System and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-051], [T-052]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-051], [T-052]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-051], [T-052]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: In layout and restaurant components (Hero, FeaturedItems, etc.), call `useTheme()` and apply Tailwind classes from the theme object to root containers, headings, and key elements.
- [ ] Step 2: Ensure class composition works well with optional `className` props.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] Code must follow Global Rules.md guidelines
- [ ] Type safety must be maintained (TypeScript)
- [ ] Error handling must be implemented appropriately

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Extend existing component tests to assert relevant theme class names appear when a theme is provided.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

- This task is part of **Phase 4: Theme System**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-051], [T-052]
- **Dependencies**: [T-051], [T-052]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
