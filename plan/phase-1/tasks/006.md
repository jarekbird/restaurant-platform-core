# TASK-006: Implement TanStack Query provider with devtools

**Section**: B. Phase 0: Bootstrap the Core App
**Subsection**: B.6
**Task ID**: T-011

## Description

Implement TanStack Query provider with devtools. This task involves: Update `app/providers.tsx` to match the `master-plan.md` design:; `"use client"` at top.; Use `QueryClient`, `QueryClientProvider`, `ReactQueryDevtools`, and `useState` to create a single client instance.; and more. This task is part of Phase 0: Bootstrap the Core App and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-010]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-010]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-010]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Update `app/providers.tsx` to match the `master-plan.md` design:
- [ ] Step 2: `"use client"` at top.
- [ ] Step 3: Use `QueryClient`, `QueryClientProvider`, `ReactQueryDevtools`, and `useState` to create a single client instance.
- [ ] Step 4: Export `Providers({ children })` that wraps children in `QueryClientProvider` and renders `ReactQueryDevtools` with `initialIsOpen={false}`.
- [ ] Step 5: Update `app/layout.tsx` to wrap the body contents with `<Providers>`.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] Code must follow Global Rules.md guidelines
- [ ] Type safety must be maintained (TypeScript)
- [ ] Error handling must be implemented appropriately

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add a test `test/providers.spec.tsx` that renders a dummy child inside `Providers` and asserts it renders without error.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 0: Bootstrap the Core App**
