# TASK-001: Install remaining core dependencies

**Section**: A. Tooling & Baseline App Health
**Subsection**: A.1
**Task ID**: T-001

## Description

Install remaining core dependencies. This task involves: Add `zod`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, and a test runner (`vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`) to `package.json` and install.; Add an npm script `"test": "vitest"` and `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`. This task is part of Tooling & Baseline App Health and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: None
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: None

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: None
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add `zod`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, and a test runner (`vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`) to `package.json` and install.
- [ ] Step 2: Add an npm script `"test": "vitest"` and `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **Dependency Installation**:
  - [ ] All packages must be installed successfully in `node_modules`
  - [ ] `package.json` must be updated with correct version ranges
  - [ ] `package-lock.json` must be updated and committed
  - [ ] No peer dependency warnings that would cause runtime issues
  - [ ] All npm scripts must be functional and executable


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Write appropriate tests if required
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Tooling & Baseline App Health**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: None (can start immediately)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently

## Test Cases / User Stories

The following test cases must be implemented and passing for this task to be considered complete:

### Test Case 1: Code compiles without TypeScript errors

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm run build` completes successfully with no type errors

**User Story**: As a developer, I want code compiles without typescript errors so that `npm run build` completes successfully with no type errors.

---

### Test Case 2: Code passes ESLint validation

**Type**: Lint Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings

**User Story**: As a developer, I want code passes eslint validation so that `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings.

---

### Test Case 3: All packages are installed and accessible

**Type**: Integration Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Can import all installed packages in a test file without errors

**User Story**: As a developer, I want all packages are installed and accessible so that can import all installed packages in a test file without errors.

---

### Test Case 4: npm scripts are functional

**Type**: Functional Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm test` and `npm run test:watch` commands execute without errors

**User Story**: As a developer, I want npm scripts are functional so that `npm test` and `npm run test:watch` commands execute without errors.

---

## Definition of Done

This is a **SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Test Verification Requirements**:
- [ ] All test cases listed above must be implemented
- [ ] All test cases must pass (`npm test` completes successfully)
- [ ] Test coverage must be maintained or improved
- [ ] No test warnings or errors should be present
- [ ] All user stories must be validated through passing tests



**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete
