# TASK-001: Install remaining core dependencies

**Section**: A. Tooling & Baseline App Health
**Subsection**: A.1
**Task ID**: T-001

## Description

Install remaining core dependencies. This task involves: Add `zod`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, and a test runner (`vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`) to `package.json` and install.; Add an npm script `"test": "vitest"` and `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`. This task is part of Tooling & Baseline App Health and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: None
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: None

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: None
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add `zod`, `@tanstack/react-query-devtools`, and a test runner (`vitest` + `@testing-library/react` + `@testing-library/jest-dom`) to `package.json` and install.
- [ ] Step 2: Add an npm script `"test": "vitest"` and `"test:watch": "vitest --watch"`.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] Code must follow Global Rules.md guidelines
- [ ] Type safety must be maintained (TypeScript)
- [ ] Error handling must be implemented appropriately

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Write appropriate tests if required
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Tooling & Baseline App Health**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: None (can start immediately)
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices

## Definition of Done

This is a **SYSTEM/ENVIRONMENT OPERATION TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "The required operation must complete successfully with no errors, and the expected artifacts must be created. If any part of the operation fails, the task is NOT complete."

**Important Notes**:
- Installing dependencies requires packages to actually be installed successfully
- Updating package.json is NOT enough
- If the output mentions environmental issues, errors, warnings, or failed operations, the task is NOT complete
