# TASK-032: Create `templates/site` minimal Next app structure

**Section**: H. Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding
**Subsection**: H.32
**Task ID**: T-070

## Description

Create `templates/site` minimal Next app structure. This task involves: Add `templates/site/app`, `templates/site/components`, `templates/site/lib`, and `templates/site/data`.; Include a minimal Next.js app (can be adapted from the core app) that reads local `data/menu.json` and `data/config.json`.; Use a simplified layout and components referencing the core design patterns. This task is part of Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-041], [T-050]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-041], [T-050]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-041], [T-050]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add `templates/site/app`, `templates/site/components`, `templates/site/lib`, and `templates/site/data`.
- [ ] Step 2: Include a minimal Next.js app (can be adapted from the core app) that reads local `data/menu.json` and `data/config.json`.
- [ ] Step 3: Use a simplified layout and components referencing the core design patterns.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Write appropriate tests if required
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-041], [T-050]
- **Dependencies**: [T-041], [T-050]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Requires dependencies to be completed first
- **Current State**: See execution-order.md for detailed current state information
