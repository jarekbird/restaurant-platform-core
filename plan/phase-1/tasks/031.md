**Task ID**: T-062

## Description

Document LLM prompt template entry point. This task involves: Create `docs/ai/prompts.md` with a section "Menu Extraction Prompt", specifying input format, output JSON shape, and rules (no hallucinations, preserve order, etc.).; Reference the `callLLMToGenerateMenuJson` function as the implementation target. This task is part of Phase 5: AI Menu Ingestion Tooling and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State
