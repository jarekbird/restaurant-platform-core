- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Implement `RestaurantLayout` that accepts `config: RestaurantConfig` and `children`.
- [ ] Step 2: Render:
- [ ] Step 3: Header with logo or restaurant name + navigation stub.
- [ ] Step 4: Footer with address, hours, and phone.
- [ ] Step 5: Main area that renders `children`.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **Component Requirements**:
  - [ ] Component must accept all required props with proper TypeScript types
  - [ ] Component must handle optional props gracefully
  - [ ] Component must be accessible (ARIA labels, semantic HTML)
  - [ ] Component must be responsive and work on mobile/tablet/desktop
  - [ ] Component must accept and apply `className` prop for styling flexibility


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add `test/components/RestaurantLayout.spec.tsx` that passes a mock `RestaurantConfig` and asserts header/footer pieces render.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 2: Core UI Components**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-022], [T-012]

- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
