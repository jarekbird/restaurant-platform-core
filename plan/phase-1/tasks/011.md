# TASK-011: Implement `restaurant.ts` Zod schemas

**Section**: C. Phase 1: Domain Modeling
**Subsection**: C.11
**Task ID**: T-022

## Description

Implement `restaurant.ts` Zod schemas. This task involves: Create `lib/schemas/restaurant.ts` implementing:; `hoursSchema` as a record keyed by `"mon" | ... | "sun"` with string values like `"11:00-21:00"`.; `restaurantConfigSchema` with fields from the master plan (`id`, `name`, `slug`, address fields, `phone`, `email?`, `hours`, `cuisine`, `theme`, `heroImage?`, `logo?`, `orderOnlineEnabled` default `false`).; and more. This task is part of Phase 1: Domain Modeling and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-020]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-020]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-020]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create `lib/schemas/restaurant.ts` implementing:
- [ ] Step 2: `hoursSchema` as a record keyed by `"mon" | ... | "sun"` with string values like `"11:00-21:00"`.
- [ ] Step 3: `restaurantConfigSchema` with fields from the master plan (`id`, `name`, `slug`, address fields, `phone`, `email?`, `hours`, `cuisine`, `theme`, `heroImage?`, `logo?`, `orderOnlineEnabled` default `false`).
- [ ] Step 4: Export `RestaurantConfig` via `z.infer<typeof restaurantConfigSchema>`.

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **Schema Validation**:
  - [ ] All schemas must properly validate required fields
  - [ ] Optional fields must be handled correctly
  - [ ] Default values must be applied when appropriate
  - [ ] Type inference must work correctly for all schemas
  - [ ] Invalid data must throw descriptive validation errors


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add `test/schemas/restaurant-schema.spec.ts` validating a good object and a few bad ones (e.g., invalid day key, missing `slug`).
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 1: Domain Modeling**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-020]
- **Dependencies**: [T-020]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Requires dependencies to be completed first
- **Current State**: See execution-order.md for detailed current state information

### Test Case 2: Code passes ESLint validation

**Type**: Lint Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings

**User Story**: As a developer, I want code passes eslint validation so that `npm run lint` completes with no errors or warnings.

---

### Test Case 3: Valid data passes schema validation

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Schema.parse() succeeds with valid input data

**User Story**: As a developer, I want valid data passes schema validation so that schema.parse() succeeds with valid input data.

---

### Test Case 4: Invalid data throws validation errors

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Schema.parse() throws ZodError with descriptive messages for invalid input

**User Story**: As a developer, I want invalid data throws validation errors so that schema.parse() throws zoderror with descriptive messages for invalid input.

---

### Test Case 5: Optional fields are handled correctly

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Schema accepts data with optional fields missing

**User Story**: As a developer, I want optional fields are handled correctly so that schema accepts data with optional fields missing.

---

### Test Case 6: Default values are applied

**Type**: Unit Test

**Acceptance Criteria**: Schema applies default values when fields are missing

**User Story**: As a developer, I want default values are applied so that schema applies default values when fields are missing.
