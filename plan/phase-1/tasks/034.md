# TASK-034: Implement `scripts/scaffold-site.ts` CLI

**Section**: H. Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding
**Subsection**: H.34
**Task ID**: T-072

## Description

Implement `scripts/scaffold-site.ts` CLI. This task involves: Implement CLI with inputs: `restaurantSlug`, `outputPath`.; Copy `templates/site` to `outputPath`.; Copy `data/restaurants/<slug>/menu.json` and `config.json` into the new site's `data` directory.; and more. This task is part of Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding and contributes to building the restaurant platform core application.

**Reference Implementation**: `plan/phase-1/master-plan.md`

## Current State

- Previous tasks: [T-070], [T-071], [T-040]
- Current limitations: Dependencies must be completed before starting this task
- Relevant context: See execution-order.md for full task details

**Important**: This task depends on: [T-070], [T-071], [T-040]

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review relevant documentation and reference implementations
- [ ] Understand dependencies and prerequisites: [T-070], [T-071], [T-040]
- [ ] Set up any required tooling or environment
- [ ] Review related tasks and their status
- [ ] Identify any blockers or risks

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Implement CLI with inputs: `restaurantSlug`, `outputPath`.
- [ ] Step 2: Copy `templates/site` to `outputPath`.
- [ ] Step 3: Copy `data/restaurants/<slug>/menu.json` and `config.json` into the new site's `data` directory.
- [ ] Step 4: Replace placeholders in the new site's `package.json`, `next.config`, etc., with restaurant-specific values (name, slug).

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] All requirements from execution-order.md must be met
- [ ] **Code Quality**:
  - [ ] All code must follow TypeScript best practices
  - [ ] All code must pass ESLint without errors
  - [ ] All code must be properly typed (no `any` types unless absolutely necessary)
  - [ ] All functions must have appropriate JSDoc/TSDoc comments

- [ ] **CLI Script Requirements**:
  - [ ] Script must parse command-line arguments correctly
  - [ ] Script must validate inputs before processing
  - [ ] Script must handle file I/O errors gracefully
  - [ ] Script must provide clear error messages
  - [ ] Script must create directories if they do not exist


### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error cases appropriately
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Ensure proper validation

### Testing

- [ ] Add `test/scripts/scaffold-site.spec.ts` that runs the CLI in a temp directory and asserts:
- [ ] Files are copied.
- [ ] Data files exist and contain expected content.
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run build` (TypeScript check)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead
- [ ] Ensure all affected functionality is covered by automated tests

### Documentation

- [ ] Update code comments and JSDoc/TSDoc as needed
- [ ] Update relevant documentation files if structural changes were made
- [ ] Document any patterns or conventions established

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all requirements are met
- [ ] Verify no regressions were introduced
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met
- [ ] Review code for best practices
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling is in place

## Notes

- This task is part of **Phase 6: Restaurant Scaffolding**
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after completing dependencies: [T-070], [T-071], [T-040]
- **Dependencies**: [T-070], [T-071], [T-040]
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Follow Global Rules.md for all implementation
  - Maintain type safety with TypeScript
  - Write comprehensive tests
  - Follow Next.js and React best practices
- **Task Independence**: Requires dependencies to be completed first
- **Current State**: See execution-order.md for detailed current state information
