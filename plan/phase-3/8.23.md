# TASK-8.23: Run full test suite and fix regressions

**Section**: 8. Final Polish & Demo Validation
**Subsection**: 8.23
**Task ID**: TASK-8.23

## Description

Run lint, type-check, and full test suite. Ensure no regressions from Phase 2 (cart + AI chatbot flows still work as before). Fix any issues found.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- Phase 2 components (cart, AI chatbot)
- Test suite configuration

## Current State

All Phase 3 tasks have been completed. Final validation is needed to ensure everything works together and no regressions were introduced.

**Important**: This is the final task in Phase 3. Execute after TASK-8.22.

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Run linting
  - [ ] Run `npm run lint`
  - [ ] Fix any linting errors
- [ ] Step 2: Run type checking
  - [ ] Run `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
  - [ ] Fix any type errors
- [ ] Step 3: Run full test suite
  - [ ] Run `npm test`
  - [ ] Fix any failing tests
- [ ] Step 4: Verify Phase 2 functionality
  - [ ] Verify cart flow still works (add items, update quantities, remove items)
  - [ ] Verify AI chatbot still works (if enabled)
  - [ ] Verify checkout flow still works (mock order placement)
- [ ] Step 5: Fix any regressions
  - [ ] Address any issues found
