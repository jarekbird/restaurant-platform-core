# TASK-005: Add Owner-Style Theme Families

**Section**: 1. Theme System & Style Families
**Subsection**: 1.2
**Task ID**: TASK-005

## Description

Implement factory functions that create canonical Owner.com-style theme families. These factories will return fully-populated `RestaurantTheme` objects tuned to specific design families: Warm Casual Pizza/Bistro, Modern Asian/Sushi, Breakfast/Diner/Comfort, and Fast-Casual/Street Food.

These theme families are based on patterns observed across Owner.com restaurant sites and will serve as presets that can be applied to restaurants based on their cuisine type.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `menuhq/restaurant-finder/plan/owner-com-research.md` (design families)
- `menuhq/restaurant-finder/plan/phase-3/master-plan.md` (Section 2.2)

## Current State

- RestaurantTheme schema exists (from TASK-004)
- No theme factory functions exist
- Need to create 4 canonical theme families based on Owner.com patterns

**Prerequisites**: TASK-004 must be completed

  - [ ] Explain when to use each family

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all factories return valid themes
- [ ] Verify themes match family descriptions
- [ ] Verify serialization works
- [ ] Verify no regressions

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Owner.com-Aligned Restaurant Sites
- **Execution Timing**: After TASK-004, before TASK-006
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-004: RestaurantTheme schema must exist
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Color values should be based on Owner.com patterns from research
  - Keep themes flexible - these are starting points
  - Consider accessibility (color contrast ratios)
  - Themes can be customized later
- **Task Independence**: Can be developed after TASK-004

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-004 (RestaurantTheme schema)
- Next: TASK-006 (Theme serialization & selection)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-004: Theme schema
- Related:
  - TASK-006: Will add helpers to use these families
  - TASK-015: Will use themes in page config builders
