# TASK-1.3.2: Update existing themes with new tokens

**Section**: 1. Theme System & Owner-Style Theme Variants
**Subsection**: 1.3.2
**Task ID**: TASK-1.3.2

## Description

Update all existing themes (`sushi-dark`, `cafe-warm`, `pizza-bright`) in `lib/themes/index.ts` to include the new `accent` color token and optional `radii` values. This ensures backward compatibility and that all themes have complete token sets.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `lib/themes/index.ts` (themes record)

## Current State

Theme interface has been extended in TASK-1.3.1, but existing themes don't yet include the new tokens.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1.3.1, and before TASK-1.3.3.
