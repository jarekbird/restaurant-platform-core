# TASK-1.4: Define Owner-inspired theme variants

**Section**: 1. Theme System & Owner-Style Theme Variants
**Subsection**: 1.4
**Task ID**: TASK-1.4

## Description

Add 3–4 new Owner.com-inspired theme variants to the `themes` record in `lib/themes/index.ts`. These themes should map directly to Owner.com-style design families (e.g., `warm-pizza`, `modern-sushi`, `breakfast-diner`, `fast-casual`). Each theme should use colors and typography consistent with the research in `owner-com-research.md` and the Phase 3 master plan. Ensure `RestaurantConfig.theme` can reference these new theme keys.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `lib/themes/index.ts` (where themes are defined)
- `owner-com-research.md` (Owner.com design patterns)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 3.2 (Owner-inspired theme variants)

## Current State

The `themes` record currently has 3 themes:
- `sushi-dark`: Dark theme with black/gray colors
- `cafe-warm`: Warm amber tones
- `pizza-bright`: Bright red/white theme

The Theme interface has been extended in TASK-1.3 to include all required tokens (including `accent` color).

New Owner.com-inspired themes need to be added that align with the design families identified in the research.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1.3 (Theme interface extension), and before TASK-1.5 (wiring themes through components).

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `owner-com-research.md` for Owner.com design families and color patterns
- [ ] Review `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 3.2 for theme variant requirements
- [ ] Review existing themes in `lib/themes/index.ts` to understand structure
- [ ] Review `lib/schemas/restaurant.ts` to understand how `RestaurantConfig.theme` is used
- [ ] Identify 3–4 distinct Owner.com design families to implement

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Define theme families
  - [ ] Choose 3–4 theme names (e.g., `warm-pizza`, `modern-sushi`, `breakfast-diner`, `fast-casual`)
  - [ ] Map each theme to Owner.com design patterns from research
  - [ ] Document color choices for each theme (primary, accent, background, surface, text, etc.)
  - [ ] Document typography choices for each theme
- [ ] Step 2: Implement `warm-pizza` theme
  - [ ] Define colors: warm reds/oranges for primary, warm neutrals for background/surface
  - [ ] Define typography: bold headings, readable body
  - [ ] Add to `themes` record with all required tokens
- [ ] Step 3: Implement `modern-sushi` theme
  - [ ] Define colors: modern dark/light contrast, possibly with accent color
  - [ ] Define typography: clean, modern fonts
  - [ ] Add to `themes` record with all required tokens
- [ ] Step 4: Implement `breakfast-diner` theme
  - [ ] Define colors: warm, inviting breakfast colors (yellows, oranges, or classic diner colors)
  - [ ] Define typography: friendly, approachable fonts
  - [ ] Add to `themes` record with all required tokens
- [ ] Step 5: Implement `fast-casual` theme (or 4th theme of choice)
  - [ ] Define colors: energetic, modern colors appropriate for fast-casual dining
  - [ ] Define typography: modern, clean fonts
  - [ ] Add to `themes` record with all required tokens
- [ ] Step 6: Verify theme keys can be used in RestaurantConfig
  - [ ] Ensure `RestaurantConfig.theme` accepts the new theme keys
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme()` resolves new theme keys correctly

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Add at least 3 new Owner.com-inspired themes to the `themes` record
- [ ] Requirement 2: Each theme must include all required tokens from extended Theme interface:
  - All color tokens: `background`, `surface`, `primary`, `accent`, `text`, `textMuted`, `border`
  - All typography tokens: `heading`, `body`
  - Optional shape tokens if added in TASK-1.3
- [ ] Requirement 3: Theme colors and typography must align with Owner.com design patterns from research
- [ ] Requirement 4: Theme names should be descriptive and map to Owner.com design families
- [ ] Requirement 5: `getTheme(themeKey)` must resolve new theme keys correctly
- [ ] Requirement 6: `RestaurantConfig.theme` must be able to reference new theme keys

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Ensure `getTheme()` handles new theme keys correctly (no fallback needed if keys are valid)
- [ ] Ensure TypeScript types are updated if theme keys are exported as a type
- [ ] Handle case where a theme key is referenced but not yet defined (should fallback to default)

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for each new theme key:
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme('warm-pizza')` returns a Theme object
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme('modern-sushi')` returns a Theme object
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme('breakfast-diner')` returns a Theme object
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme('fast-casual')` (or 4th theme) returns a Theme object
- [ ] Write unit tests verifying each theme has all required tokens:
  - [ ] For each new theme, assert all color tokens are present and non-empty
  - [ ] For each new theme, assert all typography tokens are present and non-empty
  - [ ] For each new theme, assert optional tokens are present if added to interface
- [ ] Write tests verifying theme colors match expected qualitative patterns:
  - [ ] Test that primary color is distinct from background
  - [ ] Test that accent color is distinct from primary
  - [ ] Test that text colors have sufficient contrast (if possible to test)
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments for each new theme describing its design family
- [ ] Document color choices and rationale for each theme
- [ ] Document typography choices for each theme
- [ ] Update any theme-related documentation to include new themes

### Verification

- [ ] Verify all new themes are added to `themes` record
- [ ] Verify each theme has all required tokens
- [ ] Verify theme colors align with Owner.com design patterns
- [ ] Verify `getTheme()` resolves new theme keys
- [ ] Verify `RestaurantConfig.theme` can reference new keys
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Theme System & Owner-Style Theme Variants
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1.3, before TASK-1.5
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1.3: Extend Theme type and theme utilities (must have extended Theme interface)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Theme colors should be Tailwind CSS class strings (e.g., `'bg-red-600 text-white'`)
  - Colors should align with Owner.com research findings
  - Themes should be distinct enough to showcase different design families
  - Consider accessibility (contrast ratios) when choosing colors
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-1.3
- **Current State**: Theme interface is extended, but only 3 existing themes exist. New Owner.com-inspired themes need to be added.

## Definition of Done

This is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "At least 3 new Owner.com-inspired theme variants have been added to the `themes` record in `lib/themes/index.ts`. Each theme includes all required tokens (colors, typography, optional shape tokens). Theme colors and typography align with Owner.com design patterns from research. Unit tests verify each theme key resolves correctly and has all required tokens. All tests pass. Code is committed and pushed to origin."

**User Stories**:
- As a restaurant owner, I want to choose from Owner.com-inspired themes so my preview site looks professional and conversion-optimized
- As a developer, I want distinct theme families so I can showcase different design styles
- As a component, I want to access new theme tokens via `getTheme()` so I can apply Owner.com-aligned styling

**Automated Tests**: 
- Unit tests for `getTheme()` returning Theme objects for each new theme key (`warm-pizza`, `modern-sushi`, `breakfast-diner`, `fast-casual` or 4th theme)
- Unit tests verifying each new theme has all required color tokens (background, surface, primary, accent, text, textMuted, border)
- Unit tests verifying each new theme has all required typography tokens (heading, body)
- Unit tests verifying theme colors match expected qualitative patterns (primary distinct from background, accent distinct from primary)

**Git Commit & Push**: 
- Commit with message: `feat(phase-3): add Owner.com-inspired theme variants (TASK-1.4)`
- Push to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- Ensure all test files are included in the commit
