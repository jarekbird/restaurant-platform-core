# TASK-8.22: Polish copy and defaults for demo restaurants

**Section**: 8. Final Polish & Demo Validation
**Subsection**: 8.22
**Task ID**: TASK-8.22

## Description

Update demo data in `data/` so at least a couple of restaurants use different Owner-style themes, have good hero images, menu images, and descriptive copy. This is a data/content task to make the demo look polished.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `data/` directory (demo restaurant data)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` (theme requirements)

## Current State

Demo restaurants may not have optimal data (images, copy, themes) for showcasing Phase 3 features.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-7.21, and before TASK-8.23.
