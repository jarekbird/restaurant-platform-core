# TASK-001: Create the Python Project Skeleton

**Section**: 0. Project Scaffolding & Foundations
**Subsection**: 0.1
**Task ID**: TASK-001

## Description

Initialize a new Python package for the restaurant site planner that will generate Owner.com-aligned website configurations. This task establishes the project structure, build system, testing framework, and basic package layout needed for all subsequent development.

The package will be named `restaurant_site_planner` and will serve as the core Python application that transforms restaurant data into structured website configurations following Owner.com patterns.

**Reference Implementation**: `menuhq/restaurant-finder/processing/` (existing Python project structure)

## Current State

- No Python package exists yet for the site planner
- The `restaurant-finder` project has a `processing/` directory with Python scripts for menu extraction
- The project uses TypeScript/Node.js for ingestion, but Phase 3 requires a Python app for configuration generation
- No test framework is configured for this new package
- No build system or dependency management is set up

**Prerequisites**: None - this is the first task in Phase 3

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review existing Python project structure in `processing/` directory
- [ ] Decide on Python version (recommend 3.11+)
- [ ] Review `pyproject.toml` vs `requirements.txt` approach (recommend `pyproject.toml` for modern Python)
- [ ] Choose test framework (recommend `pytest`)
- [ ] Review project structure patterns from `processing/` directory

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create package directory structure
  - [ ] Create `src/restaurant_site_planner/` directory
  - [ ] Create `src/restaurant_site_planner/__init__.py` with package metadata
  - [ ] Create `tests/` directory at project root
  - [ ] Create `tests/__init__.py`
  - [ ] Create `tests/test_smoke.py` for initial smoke test
- [ ] Step 2: Set up build system and dependencies
  - [ ] Create `pyproject.toml` with:
    - [ ] Project metadata (name, version, description, authors)
    - [ ] Python version requirement (>=3.11)
    - [ ] Build system configuration (setuptools or hatchling)
    - [ ] Dependencies section (initially empty, will be populated in later tasks)
    - [ ] Optional dependencies for development
  - [ ] Add `pytest` as a development dependency
  - [ ] Add `pytest-cov` for coverage (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Step 3: Configure testing framework
  - [ ] Create `pytest.ini` or add `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` to `pyproject.toml`
  - [ ] Configure test discovery patterns
  - [ ] Set up test paths and markers
  - [ ] Configure coverage settings if using pytest-cov
- [ ] Step 4: Create initial documentation
  - [ ] Create `README.md` with:
    - [ ] Project description
    - [ ] Installation instructions
    - [ ] Basic usage example (placeholder)
    - [ ] Development setup instructions
    - [ ] Testing instructions
  - [ ] Add `.gitignore` entries for Python artifacts (if not already present)
- [ ] Step 5: Write and verify smoke test
  - [ ] Create `tests/test_smoke.py` with a trivial test
  - [ ] Test imports the package successfully
  - [ ] Test verifies Python environment is working
  - [ ] Run `pytest` to confirm test harness works

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Package structure follows Python best practices
  - [ ] Uses `src/` layout (not flat package structure)
  - [ ] `__init__.py` files are present in all package directories
  - [ ] Package name is `restaurant_site_planner` (snake_case)
- [ ] Requirement 2: Build system is modern and maintainable
  - [ ] Uses `pyproject.toml` (PEP 518/621 compliant)
  - [ ] Supports editable installs (`pip install -e .`)
  - [ ] Dependencies are clearly specified
- [ ] Requirement 3: Testing framework is properly configured
  - [ ] `pytest` can discover and run tests
  - [ ] Test output is clear and informative
  - [ ] Tests can be run with `pytest` command from project root

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error case 1: Python version incompatibility
  - [ ] `pyproject.toml` specifies minimum Python version
  - [ ] Clear error message if Python version is too old
- [ ] Handle error case 2: Missing dependencies
  - [ ] Installation instructions are clear
  - [ ] Dependencies are properly declared

### Testing

- [ ] Write smoke test: `tests/test_smoke.py`
  - [ ] Test imports `restaurant_site_planner` package
  - [ ] Test verifies package `__init__.py` exists and is importable
  - [ ] Test passes with `pytest tests/test_smoke.py`
- [ ] Verify test discovery works: `pytest` (no arguments) finds the test
- [ ] Verify test output is readable and informative
- [ ] Run full test suite: `pytest` (should pass with just smoke test)
- [ ] Verify test can be run from different directories

### Documentation

- [ ] Update `README.md` with:
  - [ ] Project purpose and goals
  - [ ] Installation: `pip install -e .`
  - [ ] Running tests: `pytest`
  - [ ] Development setup instructions
- [ ] Add docstring to `src/restaurant_site_planner/__init__.py` describing the package
- [ ] Document Python version requirement clearly

### Verification

- [ ] Verify package can be installed: `pip install -e .`
- [ ] Verify package can be imported: `python -c "import restaurant_site_planner"`
- [ ] Verify tests pass: `pytest`
- [ ] Verify project structure matches Python best practices
- [ ] Verify no unnecessary files are committed (check `.gitignore`)

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Owner.com-Aligned Restaurant Sites
- **Execution Timing**: This is the first task and must be completed before any other Phase 3 tasks
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use modern Python packaging standards (PEP 518, PEP 621)
  - The `src/` layout is preferred over flat package structure for better testing isolation
  - Keep dependencies minimal initially - add more as needed in later tasks
- **Task Independence**: This task is completely independent and can be started immediately
- **Current State**: No Python package exists for site planning yet

## Related Tasks

- Previous: None (first task)
- Next: TASK-002 (Define core domain models)
- Dependencies: None
- Related:
  - TASK-002: Will use this package structure
  - TASK-003: Will add models to this package

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: CODE/FILE WRITING TASK

**User Stories**:
1. **As a developer**, I want a Python package structure that follows best practices so I can develop features efficiently
2. **As a developer**, I want a working test framework so I can write and run tests for all features
3. **As a developer**, I want clear documentation so I can understand how to set up and use the project

**Automated Tests**:
- [ ] Smoke test exists in `tests/test_smoke.py`
- [ ] Smoke test passes: `pytest tests/test_smoke.py` exits with code 0
