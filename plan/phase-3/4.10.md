# TASK-4.10: Add an AboutSection component

**Section**: 4. Story, Social Proof, and Capture Modules
**Subsection**: 4.10
**Task ID**: TASK-4.10

## Description

Create a new `AboutSection` component that uses `RestaurantConfig` plus some mock text to render a heading (e.g., "Our Story"), and 1–3 paragraphs of descriptive copy about the restaurant. The copy can be hard-coded lorem text tuned to cuisine for now. Make the component theme-aware using `useTheme()` and suitable for placement below the menu section in the preview layout.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/HeroSection.tsx` (example of theme-aware component)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.4 (Social Proof & Story)

## Current State

There is no dedicated "Our Story" or "About" section in the preview layout. The preview page currently shows:
- HeroSection
- MenuSectionList
- HoursAndLocation

A new `AboutSection` component needs to be created that:
- Displays "Our Story" or similar heading
- Shows 1–3 paragraphs of descriptive text (mocked for now)
- Uses theme tokens for styling
- Can be placed below the menu section

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-3.9, and before TASK-4.11.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `RestaurantConfig` schema to understand available fields
- [ ] Review `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.4 for requirements
- [ ] Review Owner.com "Our Story" patterns from research
- [ ] Review how other restaurant components use `useTheme()`

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create AboutSection component file
  - [ ] Create `components/restaurant/AboutSection.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary dependencies (`RestaurantConfig`, `useTheme`, `cn`)
- [ ] Step 2: Implement component structure
  - [ ] Accept `config: RestaurantConfig` as prop
  - [ ] Use `useTheme()` to access theme tokens
  - [ ] Render heading (e.g., "Our Story")
  - [ ] Render 1–3 paragraphs of descriptive text
- [ ] Step 3: Add mock content
  - [ ] Create mock text that can be tuned to cuisine type
  - [ ] Use `config.cuisine` to customize text (optional, can be generic for now)
  - [ ] Ensure text is conversion-focused and engaging
- [ ] Step 4: Apply theme tokens
  - [ ] Use `theme.colors.background` or `theme.colors.surface` for section background
  - [ ] Use `theme.colors.text` for heading
  - [ ] Use `theme.colors.textMuted` for body text
  - [ ] Use `theme.typography.heading` for heading
  - [ ] Use `theme.typography.body` for body text
- [ ] Step 5: Ensure responsive layout
  - [ ] Test on mobile (text should be readable)
  - [ ] Test on tablet/desktop
  - [ ] Ensure proper spacing and padding

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Component must display a heading:
  - Heading text: "Our Story" or similar
  - Heading must use theme tokens (`theme.colors.text`, `theme.typography.heading`)
- [ ] Requirement 2: Component must display 1–3 paragraphs:
  - Paragraphs should be descriptive and engaging
  - Can be mocked/hard-coded for now (tuned to cuisine if possible)
  - Paragraphs must use theme tokens (`theme.colors.textMuted`, `theme.typography.body`)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Component must be theme-aware:
  - Use `useTheme()` hook
  - Apply theme tokens for all colors and typography
  - Component should adapt to different theme keys
- [ ] Requirement 4: Component must accept `RestaurantConfig`:
  - Accept `config: RestaurantConfig` as prop
  - Can use `config.cuisine` to customize text (optional)
- [ ] Requirement 5: Component must be suitable for placement below menu:
  - Should have appropriate spacing/padding
  - Should not break layout flow

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where `config` is missing (should not happen, but handle gracefully)
- [ ] Handle case where `config.cuisine` is missing (use generic text)
- [ ] Ensure component renders even with minimal config

### Testing

- [ ] Write component tests:
  - [ ] Test that component renders heading "Our Story"
  - [ ] Test that component renders 1–3 paragraphs
  - [ ] Test that component uses theme tokens for colors and typography
  - [ ] Test that component renders correctly with different theme keys
  - [ ] Test that component accepts `RestaurantConfig` prop
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments to component
- [ ] Document prop types and usage
- [ ] Document theme token usage
- [ ] Document mock content approach

### Verification

- [ ] Verify component renders heading and paragraphs
- [ ] Verify component uses theme tokens correctly
- [ ] Verify component works with different theme keys
- [ ] Verify responsive layout works
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Story, Social Proof, and Capture Modules
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-3.9, before TASK-4.11
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1.5: Wire themes through Restaurant components (component should use theme tokens)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Content is mocked for now (can be replaced with real content later)
  - Component should be conversion-focused (Owner.com pattern)
  - Component should establish trust and brand story
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-1.5
- **Current State**: No AboutSection component exists

## Definition of Done

This is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "A new `AboutSection` component has been created in `components/restaurant/AboutSection.tsx` that displays 'Our Story' heading and 1–3 paragraphs of descriptive text (mocked).
