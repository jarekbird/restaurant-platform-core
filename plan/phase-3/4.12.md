# TASK-4.12: Integrate story & social proof into preview layout

**Section**: 4. Story, Social Proof, and Capture Modules
**Subsection**: 4.12
**Task ID**: TASK-4.12

## Description

Update `app/preview/[slug]/page.tsx` or `RestaurantLayout` children usage to insert `AboutSection` and `ReviewHighlights` below `MenuSectionList` but above the footer. Ensure they can be toggled via simple flags in the loaded restaurant config (optional for now, can be always-on for demo).

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `app/preview/[slug]/page.tsx` (current preview page structure)
- `components/restaurant/AboutSection.tsx` (from TASK-4.10)
- `components/restaurant/ReviewHighlights.tsx` (from TASK-4.11)

## Current State

The preview page currently renders:
- HeroSection
- MenuSectionList
- HoursAndLocation

`AboutSection` and `ReviewHighlights` components have been created but are not yet integrated into the preview layout.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-4.11, and before TASK-4.13.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup
