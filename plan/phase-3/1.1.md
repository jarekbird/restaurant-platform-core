# TASK-001.1: Create Package Directory Structure

**Section**: 0. Project Scaffolding & Foundations
**Subsection**: 0.1.1
**Task ID**: TASK-001.1
**Parent Task**: TASK-001

## Description

Create the basic directory structure for the Python package. This includes the `src/` layout with the main package directory and the `tests/` directory for test files.

This is the first step in setting up the project skeleton and establishes the foundation for all subsequent development.

**Reference Implementation**: `menuhq/restaurant-finder/processing/` (existing Python project structure)

## Current State

- No Python package exists yet for the site planner
- Project root exists
- Need to create package and test directories

**Prerequisites**: None - this is the first subtask

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review existing Python project structure in `processing/` directory
- [ ] Understand Python package structure best practices
- [ ] Plan directory layout

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create main package directory
  - [ ] Create `src/restaurant_site_planner/` directory
  - [ ] Create `src/restaurant_site_planner/__init__.py` file
  - [ ] Add basic package metadata to `__init__.py`:
    - [ ] `__version__ = "0.1.0"`
    - [ ] `__package__ = "restaurant_site_planner"`
- [ ] Step 2: Create tests directory
  - [ ] Create `tests/` directory at project root
  - [ ] Create `tests/__init__.py` file
- [ ] Step 3: Verify structure
  - [ ] Verify directories exist
  - [ ] Verify `__init__.py` files are present

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Uses `src/` layout
  - [ ] Package is in `src/restaurant_site_planner/`
  - [ ] Not flat package structure
- [ ] Requirement 2: All directories have `__init__.py`
  - [ ] `src/restaurant_site_planner/__init__.py` exists
  - [ ] `tests/__init__.py` exists

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle error case 1: Directories already exist
  - [ ] Check before creating
  - [ ] Don't fail if already exists

### Testing

- [ ] Write smoke test: `tests/test_smoke.py`
  - [ ] Test imports `restaurant_site_planner` package
  - [ ] Test verifies package `__init__.py` exists and is importable
  - [ ] Test passes: `pytest tests/test_smoke.py`

### Documentation

- [ ] Add docstring to `src/restaurant_site_planner/__init__.py` describing the package

### Verification

- [ ] Verify package can be imported: `python -c "import restaurant_site_planner"`
- [ ] Verify directory structure is correct
- [ ] Verify `__init__.py` files exist

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Owner.com-Aligned Restaurant Sites
- **Execution Timing**: First subtask of TASK-001
- **Dependencies**: None
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Use `src/` layout for better testing isolation
  - Package name is `restaurant_site_planner` (snake_case)
- **Task Independence**: Can be started immediately

## Related Tasks

- Parent: TASK-001 (Create Python project skeleton)
- Next: TASK-001.2 (Set up build system)
- Dependencies: None

## Definition of Done

### Task Type: CODE/FILE WRITING TASK

**User Stories**:
1. **As a developer**, I want a proper package directory structure so I can organize code effectively

**Automated Tests**:
- [ ] Smoke test exists: `tests/test_smoke.py`
- [ ] Smoke test passes: `pytest tests/test_smoke.py` exits with code 0
- [ ] Package can be imported: `python -c "import restaurant_site_planner"` succeeds

**Code Quality**:
- [ ] Directory structure follows Python best practices
- [ ] `__init__.py` files are present

**Git & Version Control**:
- [ ] All new directories and files are added to git: `git add .`
- [ ] Changes are committed: `git commit -m "TASK-001.1: Create package directory structure"`
- [ ] Code is pushed to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- [ ] Commit message includes task ID: TASK-001.1

**Final Verification**:
- [ ] All checklist items completed
- [ ] Package structure is correct
- [ ] Package can be imported
- [ ] Code committed and pushed
