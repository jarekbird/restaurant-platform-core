# TASK-4.11: Add a ReviewHighlights component

**Section**: 4. Story, Social Proof, and Capture Modules
**Subsection**: 4.11
**Task ID**: TASK-4.11

## Description

Create a new `ReviewHighlights` component that renders static/demo content showing an aggregate rating (e.g., "4.8 / 5") and review count, plus 1–3 short review quotes. This component is purely presentational for now (later it can be wired to real data). Make it theme-aware and suitable for placement in the preview layout.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/AboutSection.tsx` (similar structure, theme-aware)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.4 (Social Proof & Story)

## Current State

There is no review or social proof component in the preview layout. A new `ReviewHighlights` component needs to be created that displays ratings and review quotes to build trust and social proof.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-4.10, and before TASK-4.12.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.4 for requirements
- [ ] Review Owner.com review/social proof patterns from research
- [ ] Review how other components use `useTheme()`

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Create ReviewHighlights component file
  - [ ] Create `components/restaurant/ReviewHighlights.tsx`
  - [ ] Import necessary dependencies (`useTheme`, `cn`)
- [ ] Step 2: Implement component structure
  - [ ] Use `useTheme()` to access theme tokens
  - [ ] Render aggregate rating (e.g., "4.8 / 5")
  - [ ] Render review count (e.g., "Based on 127 reviews")
  - [ ] Render 1–3 short review quotes
- [ ] Step 3: Add mock content
  - [ ] Hard-code aggregate rating (e.g., 4.8)
  - [ ] Hard-code review count (e.g., 127)
  - [ ] Hard-code 1–3 review quotes with reviewer names
- [ ] Step 4: Apply theme tokens
  - [ ] Use theme tokens for all colors and typography
  - [ ] Ensure component adapts to different theme keys
- [ ] Step 5: Ensure responsive layout
  - [ ] Test on mobile and desktop
  - [ ] Ensure quotes are readable

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Component must display aggregate rating:
  - Format: "4.8 / 5" or similar
  - Rating must be prominently displayed
- [ ] Requirement 2: Component must display review count:
  - Format: "Based on 127 reviews" or similar
- [ ] Requirement 3: Component must display 1–3 review quotes:
  - Each quote should have reviewer name
  - Quotes should be short and impactful
- [ ] Requirement 4: Component must be theme-aware
- [ ] Requirement 5: Component must be presentational (no real data integration yet)

### Testing

- [ ] Write component tests:
  - [ ] Test that component renders aggregate rating
  - [ ] Test that component renders review count
  - [ ] Test that component renders 1–3 review quotes
  - [ ] Test that component uses theme tokens
  - [ ] Test that component renders correctly with different theme keys
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`

### Documentation

- [ ] Add JSDoc/TSDoc comments
- [ ] Document mock content approach
