# TASK-1.3.3: Verify backward compatibility and write tests

**Section**: 1. Theme System & Owner-Style Theme Variants
**Subsection**: 1.3.3
**Task ID**: TASK-1.3.3

## Description

Verify that `getTheme()` and `useTheme()` still work correctly with the extended Theme interface. Write comprehensive tests to ensure backward compatibility and that all required tokens are present.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `lib/themes/index.ts` (getTheme function)
- `components/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx` (useTheme hook)

## Current State

Theme interface has been extended and existing themes have been updated. Need to verify backward compatibility.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1.3.2, and before TASK-1.4.1.

## Checklist

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Verify getTheme() works
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme()` returns Theme objects for existing keys
  - [ ] Test that `getTheme()` returns default theme for unknown keys
  - [ ] Test that returned Theme has all required tokens
- [ ] Step 2: Verify useTheme() works
  - [ ] Test that components using `useTheme()` can access all tokens
  - [ ] Test that existing components don't break
- [ ] Step 3: Write snapshot tests
  - [ ] Create snapshot test for a sample theme
  - [ ] This guards against accidental token removal

### Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests:
  - [ ] Test `getTheme()` returns complete Theme objects for known keys
  - [ ] Test `getTheme()` returns default theme for unknown keys
  - [ ] Test returned Theme has all required color tokens
  - [ ] Test returned Theme has all required typography tokens
- [ ] Write snapshot tests:
  - [ ] Snapshot test for a sample theme
- [ ] Write component tests:
  - [ ] Test components using `useTheme()` can access theme tokens
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test`
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint`

## Definition of Done

This is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "Backward compatibility has been verified. Unit tests verify `getTheme()` returns complete Theme objects. Snapshot tests guard against token removal. Component tests verify `useTheme()` works correctly. All tests pass. Code is committed and pushed to origin."

**User Stories**:
- As a developer, I want backward compatibility so existing components don't break
- As a component, I want to access theme tokens via `useTheme()` without breaking changes

**Automated Tests**: 
- Unit tests for `getTheme()` returning complete Theme objects
- Unit tests verifying all required tokens are present
- Snapshot tests for a sample theme
- Component tests verifying `useTheme()` works correctly

**Git Commit & Push**: 
- Commit with message: `test(phase-3): verify Theme backward compatibility and add tests (TASK-1.3.3)`
- Push to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
