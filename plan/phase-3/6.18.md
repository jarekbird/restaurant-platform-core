# TASK-6.18: Add a simple SeoContentBlock

**Section**: 6. SEO & AI Search Structure in the Prototype
**Subsection**: 6.18
**Task ID**: TASK-6.18

## Description

Create a new `SeoContentBlock` component that renders 1–2 paragraphs of descriptive copy about the restaurant and cuisine (can be mocked per demo restaurant). Insert it below `HeroSection` on the preview page. Make it theme-aware and accessible.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/AboutSection.tsx` (similar structure)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 5.2 (Heading & Content Requirements)

## Current State

No SEO content block exists below the hero section. This component will provide natural language content for SEO and AI search.

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-6.17, and before TASK-6.19.
