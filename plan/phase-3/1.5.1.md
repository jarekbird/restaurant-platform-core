# TASK-1.5.1: Wire themes through HeroSection

**Section**: 1. Theme System & Owner-Style Theme Variants
**Subsection**: 1.5.1
**Task ID**: TASK-1.5.1

## Description

Audit and update `HeroSection` component to replace any hard-coded Tailwind color/typography classes with theme-driven classes. Ensure component uses `theme.colors.*` and `theme.typography.*` tokens consistently.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/HeroSection.tsx`

## Current State

HeroSection already uses some theme tokens but may have hard-coded classes that should be theme-driven.

**Important**: Execute after TASK-1.4.4, before TASK-1.5.2.

## Checklist

### Testing
