**Section**: 2. Hero & Navigation Retrofits
**Subsection**: 2.6.1
**Task ID**: TASK-2.6.1

## Description

Add an optional tagline/benefit line to `HeroSection` derived from `config.cuisine` and `config.city` (e.g., "Authentic [cuisine] in [city]"). Use theme tokens for styling.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/HeroSection.tsx`

## Current State

HeroSection displays restaurant name and cuisine but lacks a tagline combining cuisine and city.
