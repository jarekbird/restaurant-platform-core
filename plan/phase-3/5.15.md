# TASK-5.15: Add brand-level preview route (optional)

**Section**: 5. Optional Multi-Location Demo View
**Subsection**: 5.15
**Task ID**: TASK-5.15

## Description

Add a separate preview route `app/preview/brand/[slug]/page.tsx` that renders a brand overview page showing brand name, hero imagery, short description, and a list of hard-coded "locations" with address, hours summary, and "Order from this location" buttons linking to existing `/preview/[slug]` pages.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `app/preview/[slug]/page.tsx` (existing preview route)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.7 (Multi-Location & Brand Views)

## Current State

No brand-level preview route exists. This is an optional task for showcasing multi-location patterns.

**Important**: This is an optional task. Can be skipped if not needed for Phase 3.
