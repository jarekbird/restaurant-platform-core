# TASK-2.6: Enhance HeroSection with tagline & CTA support

**Section**: 2. Hero & Navigation Retrofits
**Subsection**: 2.6
**Task ID**: TASK-2.6

## Description

Enhance the `HeroSection` component to support an optional tagline/benefit line derived from `RestaurantConfig` (e.g., "Authentic [cuisine] in [city]") and a dedicated area for a primary CTA button ("Order Online"). The CTA can call a callback passed via props or scroll to the menu section. Keep the layout responsive and image-forward, using theme tokens. This task builds on the theme-aware HeroSection from TASK-1.5.

**Reference Implementation**: 
- `components/restaurant/HeroSection.tsx` (current implementation)
- `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.1 (Hero Section & Above-the-Fold)

## Current State

The `HeroSection` component currently:
- Renders hero image (if `config.heroImage` exists)
- Displays restaurant name as H1
- Displays cuisine as a subtitle ("[cuisine] Cuisine")
- Uses theme tokens for colors and typography (from TASK-1.5)

Missing features:
- Tagline/benefit line combining cuisine and city (e.g., "Authentic [cuisine] in [city]")
- Primary CTA button area ("Order Online")
- Callback or scroll-to-menu functionality

**Important**: This task should be executed after TASK-1.5, and before TASK-2.7.

## Checklist

### Preparation and Setup

- [ ] Review current `HeroSection.tsx` implementation
- [ ] Review `RestaurantConfig` schema to understand available fields (`cuisine`, `city`, etc.)
- [ ] Review `master-plan-redacted.md` Section 4.1 for requirements
- [ ] Understand how scrolling to menu section would work (menu section ID or ref)

### Implementation Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add tagline/benefit line
  - [ ] Derive tagline from `config.cuisine` and `config.city` (e.g., "Authentic [cuisine] in [city]")
  - [ ] Add tagline text below the restaurant name (or replace current cuisine subtitle)
  - [ ] Use theme tokens for tagline styling (`theme.colors.textMuted` or appropriate)
  - [ ] Make tagline optional (only show if both `cuisine` and `city` are present)
- [ ] Step 2: Add primary CTA area
  - [ ] Add a button area below the tagline (or restaurant name if no tagline)
  - [ ] Button label: "Order Online"
  - [ ] Use theme `primary` color for button styling
  - [ ] Make CTA optional (can be enabled/disabled via props or config)
- [ ] Step 3: Implement CTA functionality
  - [ ] Option A: Accept an `onOrderClick` callback prop
  - [ ] Option B: Scroll to menu section (requires menu section to have an ID)
  - [ ] Option C: Both (callback if provided, otherwise scroll)
  - [ ] Ensure CTA is accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [ ] Step 4: Ensure responsive layout
  - [ ] Test on mobile viewport (button should be appropriately sized)
  - [ ] Test on tablet/desktop viewport
  - [ ] Ensure hero image overlay doesn't obscure text/CTA
- [ ] Step 5: Update component interface
  - [ ] Add optional props if needed (e.g., `onOrderClick?: () => void`, `showCTA?: boolean`)
  - [ ] Keep existing `config` and `className` props

### Specific Requirements

- [ ] Requirement 1: Tagline must be derived from `config.cuisine` and `config.city`:
  - Format: "Authentic [cuisine] in [city]" or similar
  - Only display if both `cuisine` and `city` are present
  - Use theme tokens for styling
- [ ] Requirement 2: Primary CTA button must:
  - Display label "Order Online"
  - Use theme `primary` color for background
  - Be accessible (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
  - Call callback or scroll to menu (as implemented)
- [ ] Requirement 3: Layout must remain responsive and image-forward:
  - Hero image (if present) should still be prominent
  - Text and CTA should be readable over image overlay
  - Mobile layout should be appropriate
- [ ] Requirement 4: Component must use theme tokens (already done in TASK-1.5, verify maintained)
- [ ] Requirement 5: Component must maintain backward compatibility (existing usage should still work)

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

- [ ] Handle case where `cuisine` is missing (don't show tagline)
- [ ] Handle case where `city` is missing (don't show tagline)
- [ ] Handle case where `heroImage` is missing (text should still be readable)
- [ ] Handle case where CTA callback is not provided (use scroll fallback or disable CTA)
- [ ] Handle case where menu section doesn't exist (if using scroll)

### Testing

- [ ] Write component tests:
  - [ ] Test that tagline renders when both `cuisine` and `city` are present
  - [ ] Test that tagline does not render when `cuisine` or `city` is missing
  - [ ] Test that CTA button renders with correct label "Order Online"
  - [ ] Test that CTA button uses theme `primary` color classes
  - [ ] Test that CTA button calls `onOrderClick` callback when provided
  - [ ] Test that CTA button scrolls to menu when callback is not provided (if implemented)
  - [ ] Test that component renders correctly with different theme keys
- [ ] Write accessibility tests:
  - [ ] Test keyboard navigation to CTA button
  - [ ] Test ARIA labels are present
- [ ] Run full test suite: `npm test` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run type checking: `npm run type-check` (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linting: `npm run lint` (if applicable)
- [ ] **DO NOT manually test by running the server** - use automated tests instead

### Documentation

- [ ] Update component JSDoc/TSDoc comments to document new props and functionality
- [ ] Document tagline derivation logic
- [ ] Document CTA behavior (callback vs scroll)
- [ ] Update any component usage documentation

### Verification

- [ ] Verify tagline renders correctly when cuisine and city are present
- [ ] Verify CTA button renders and functions correctly
- [ ] Verify responsive layout works on different viewport sizes
- [ ] Verify theme tokens are used correctly
- [ ] Verify accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [ ] Verify all tests pass
- [ ] Verify code quality standards are met

## Notes

- This task is part of Phase 3: Hero & Navigation Retrofits
- **Execution Timing**: Execute after TASK-1.5, before TASK-2.7
- **Dependencies**: 
  - TASK-1.5: Wire themes through Restaurant components (HeroSection should be theme-aware)
- **Important Considerations**: 
  - Tagline should be concise and conversion-focused
  - CTA should be prominent but not overwhelming
  - Maintain image-forward design (hero image is key)
  - Ensure accessibility (keyboard, screen readers)
- **Task Independence**: Can be completed independently after TASK-1.5
- **Current State**: HeroSection exists but lacks tagline and primary CTA

## Related Tasks

- Previous: TASK-1.5 (Wire themes through Restaurant components)
- Next: TASK-2.7 (Update RestaurantLayout header to emphasize ordering CTA)
- Dependencies:
  - TASK-1.5: Wire themes through Restaurant components
- Related:
  - TASK-2.7: Will update header CTA (this task adds hero CTA)

## Definition of Done

This is a **CODE/FILE WRITING TASK**.

**Definition of Done**: "The `HeroSection` component has been enhanced with an optional tagline derived from `config.cuisine` and `config.city` (e.g., 'Authentic [cuisine] in [city]') and a primary CTA button labeled 'Order Online'. The CTA calls a callback prop or scrolls to the menu section. Component tests verify tagline renders when cuisine/city are present, CTA button renders with correct label and theme classes, and CTA functionality works. Accessibility tests verify keyboard navigation and ARIA labels. All tests pass. Code is committed and pushed to origin."

**User Stories**:
- As a restaurant owner, I want a tagline in my hero section so visitors immediately understand my cuisine and location
- As a visitor, I want a prominent "Order Online" CTA in the hero so I can quickly start ordering
- As a developer, I want the hero CTA to be configurable (callback or scroll) so it's flexible

**Automated Tests**: 
- Component tests verifying tagline renders when both `cuisine` and `city` are present
- Component tests verifying tagline does not render when `cuisine` or `city` is missing
- Component tests verifying CTA button renders with label "Order Online" and theme `primary` color classes
- Component tests verifying CTA button calls `onOrderClick` callback when provided
- Component tests verifying CTA button scrolls to menu when callback is not provided (if implemented)
- Component tests verifying component renders correctly with different theme keys
- Accessibility tests verifying keyboard navigation and ARIA labels

**Git Commit & Push**: 
- Commit with message: `feat(phase-3): add tagline and CTA to HeroSection (TASK-2.6)`
- Push to origin: `git push origin <branch-name>`
- Ensure all test files are included in the commit
